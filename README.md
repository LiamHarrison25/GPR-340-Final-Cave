# GPR-340-Final-Cave

TODO: Add detection for world borders. (Player moves past world size)
<br />
TODO: Change the objects to bigger meshes to fix fps issue.
<br />
TODO: Tolstenko Proof the project
<br />
Idea: If meshes don't work, do fps fix using nearest neighbors. Active if a neighbor is missing.
